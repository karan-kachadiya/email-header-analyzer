**📧 Email Header Analyzer**

**🔍 Overview**

The Email Header Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to extract, analyze, and interpret email headers for security, forensic, and investigative purposes. Email headers contain valuable metadata that can help detect phishing attempts, email spoofing, and other security threats.

This tool allows users to extract details like sender and receiver information, email authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and the path an email takes through different servers. By automating email analysis, this tool helps cybersecurity professionals, digital forensic analysts, and IT administrators validate the authenticity of emails and identify potential security threats.

**🛠 Features**

✅ Extracts key email metadata – Retrieves essential email header details like From, To, Subject, Date, and Return-Path
✅ Analyzes authentication results – Extracts SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication checks to verify email legitimacy
✅ Identifies received headers – Helps track the path of an email from the sender to the receiver
✅ Automatically generates log files – Saves analysis results in a structured log file for future reference
✅ User-friendly output format – Clearly presents extracted information for easy readability

**📂 Folder Structure**

This tool organizes output files into separate folders to ensure a structured workflow:

**🚀 Installation & Usage**

1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3 is installed, then install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run the Email Header Analyzer
Use the following command to analyze an email file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python email_header_analyzer.py <email_file>
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python email_header_analyzer.py sample_email.eml

3️⃣ View Results
The analysis results will be saved in logs/email_analysis_log.txt, allowing easy access and reference for future investigations.
Each run generates a new log entry, timestamped for tracking multiple emails over time.

**🔬 How It Works**
The Email Header Analyzer follows these steps to analyze an email:

1️⃣ Reads the email file – Extracts raw email headers from the provided .eml file
2️⃣ Parses email metadata – Retrieves sender, receiver, subject, date, and return path
3️⃣ Analyzes received headers – Tracks the route the email took across servers
4️⃣ Checks authentication results – Extracts SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation results
5️⃣ Saves the analysis to a log file – Ensures results are stored for forensic and security reviews

**⚡ Use Cases**

🔹 Email Forensics – Investigate email origins and metadata for security incidents
🔹 Spam & Phishing Detection – Identify spoofed, malicious, or suspicious emails
🔹 Security Analysis – Verify email authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
🔹 Incident Response – Assist security teams in analyzing email-based attacks
🔹 IT Administration – Diagnose email delivery issues and ensure compliance with security policies
